## What is a computer exactly?

Well, if you have already study about Turing Machine you know that, but I resume:


> A Turing machine consists of a line of cells known as the "tape", together with a single active cell, known as the "head". The cells on the tape can have a certain set  of possible colors, and the head can be in a certain set of possible states.

Computers use binary language that is represented by "0" and "1" (two possibles states for cell) and this cell can be whatever thing... Data and programs

That is all a computer can do. Basically a Universal Turing Machine stands for us a computer. [Learn more](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Turing_machine)

It will be from the concept of the turing machine that Bart Computer will emerge
